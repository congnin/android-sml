# Android Architecture Blueprints - AAC + Dagger2 + Dagger-Android
### Summary
This sample is written in Kotlin and based on the
[master](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture/tree/master) branch which uses
the following Architecture Components:
 - ViewModel
 - LiveData
 - Data Binding
 - Navigation
 - Room

It uses [Dagger 2](https://dagger.dev) and
[Dagger-Android](https://dagger.dev/android.html) for dependency injection. The Dagger setup is
deliberately simple and unopinionated.

### Differences with master

 - The ServiceLocator class is removed. Object creation and scoping is handled by Dagger.
 - Flavors `mock` and `prod` are no longer needed for testing so they're removed.


### Key files

The `di` directory contains all DI-related classes. This is done to improve browsing the files
but feature modules are usually placed alongside their packages (i.e. TaskDetailModule in
the `detail` package).

`ApplicationComponent` and its testing counterpart `TestApplicationComponent` define different
modules for production and UI testing.


### Testing

UI tests don't rely on using the `mock` flavor to run quickly and hermetically. Instead, they
replace Dagger components with their test versions.

This is done by creating a `CustomTestRunner`
which starts the `TestTodoApplication` instead of the `TodoApplication`. `DaggerTestApplicationRule`
creates the `TestApplicationComponent` and injects the Application.
